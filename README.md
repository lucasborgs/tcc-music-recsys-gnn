# GraphSAGE Music Recommendation for Cold-Start 

This repository contains the implementation of a Thesis Project focused on solving the **Cold-Start problem** in music recommendation using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and **Graph Coarsening** techniques.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to recommend new music tracks (released after a specific cutoff date) that have no interaction history. By leveraging a hybrid approach that combines **Topological Structure** (via GraphSAGE) and **Content Features** (Audio Analysis), the system bridges the gap between collaborative filtering and content-based methods.

## Key Features
- **Graph Coarsening:** A hybrid dimensionality reduction pipeline that compresses the graph from **~300k to ~20k nodes**, preserving local community structures while ensuring scalability.
- **Inductive Learning:** Implementation of **GraphSAGE** to generate embeddings for unseen nodes (super-nodes) based on their features and neighborhood.
- **Hybrid Cold-Start Inference:** A novel inference strategy using **KNN** on raw audio features to map new tracks to learned Super-Node embeddings.
- **Reproducible Engineering:** The project uses a `config.yaml` based architecture with dynamic path management, ensuring portability across different environments.

## Project Structure
